  CUPS Printing Backend

  The  NoMachine Node  setup procedure could not detect your
  CUPS installation: either  CUPS  is not installed on  your
  system or it was installed in a non-standard path. CUPS is
  needed  in order to  enable  printing  support  in your NX
  system.
  Please note that you can enable  printing support for your
  NX system at any time; to do this make sure  that you have
  CUPS installed then run:

    /usr/NX/scripts/setup/nxnode --printingsetup <pathname>

  to specify the location of the CUPS root path.

  PulseAudio Backend

  The NoMachine  setup procedure  could not  detect  your  PulseAudio
  installation:  either  PulseAudio is not  installed  on your system
  or it was  installed  in a non-standard path.  If PulseAudio is not
  available, NoMachine audio support will try to rely on ALSA device.
  Please note  that you can enable  PulseAudio  support  at any time;
  to do this  make sure that you have PulseAudio installed, then run:

    /usr/NX/scripts/setup/nxnode --audiosetup <path>

  to specify the location of the PulseAudio configuration files.
